<p><a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/sigmund-freud-his-life-work-and-theories-2795860" class="external-link">Sigmund Freud's Life, Theories, and Influence</a> <br />
"Psychology's most famous figure is also one of the most influential and controversial thinkers of the 20th century. Sigmund Freud, an Austrian neurologist born in 1856, is often referred to as the 'father of modern psychology.'" <br />
"Freud revolutionized how we think about and treat mental health conditions. Freud founded psychoanalysis as a way of listening to patients and better understanding how their minds work. Psychoanalysis continues to have an enormous influence on modern psychology and psychiatry. <br />
Sigmund Freud's theories and work helped shape current views of dreams, childhood, personality, memory, sexuality, and therapy." <br />
"Freud was born in 1856 in a town called Freiberg in Moravia—in what is now known as the Czech Republic. He was the oldest of eight children. His family moved to Vienna several years after he was born, and he lived most of his life there. <br />
Freud earned a medical degree and began practicing as a doctor in Vienna. He was appointed Lecturer on Nervous Diseases at the University of Vienna in 1885." <br />
"After spending time in Paris and attending lectures given by the French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot, Freud became more interested in theories explaining the human mind (which would later relate to his work in psychoanalysis)." <br />
"Freud eventually withdrew from academia after the Viennese medical community rejected the types of ideas he brought back from Paris (specifically on what was then called <em>hysteria</em>). Freud went on to publish influential works in neurology, including 'On Aphasia: A Critical Study,' in which he coined the term <em>agnosia</em>, meaning the inability to interpret sensations." <br />
"In later years, Freud and his colleague Josef Breuer published 'Preliminary Report' and 'Studies on Hysteria.' When their friendship ended, Freud continued to publish his own works on psychoanalysis." <br />
"Freud's theories were enormously influential but subject to considerable criticism both now and during his life." <br />
"Freud's theories include:   </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/the-conscious-and-unconscious-mind-2795946" class="external-link"><strong>Unconscious mind</strong></a>: This is one of his most enduring ideas, which is that the mind is a reservoir of thoughts, memories, and emotions that lie outside the awareness of the conscious mind.2   </li>
<li><strong>Personality</strong>: Freud proposed that personality was made up of three key elements: <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/the-id-ego-and-superego-2795951" class="external-link">the id, the ego, and the superego</a>. The ego is the conscious state, the id is the unconscious, and the superego is the moral or ethical framework that regulates how the ego operates.3   </li>
<li><a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/life-and-death-instincts-2795847" class="external-link"><strong>Life and death instincts</strong></a>: Freud claimed that two classes of instincts, life and death, dictated human behavior. Life instincts include sexual procreation, survival and pleasure; death instincts include aggression, self-harm, and destruction.4   </li>
<li><a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/freuds-stages-of-psychosexual-development-2795962" class="external-link"><strong>Psychosexual development</strong></a>: Freud's theory of psychosexual development posits that there are five stages of growth in which people's personalities and sexual selves evolve. These phases are the oral stage, anal stage, phallic stage, latent stage, and genital stage.5   </li>
<li><a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/defense-mechanisms-2795960" class="external-link"><strong>Mechanisms of defense</strong></a>: Freud suggested that people use defense mechanisms to avoid anxiety. These mechanisms include displacement, repression, sublimation, and regression."   </li>
</ul>
<p>"Freud's ideas had such a strong impact on psychology that an entire school of thought emerged from his work: psychoanalysis. Psychoanalysis has had a lasting impact on both the study of psychology and the practice of psychotherapy." <br />
"Psychoanalysis sought to bring unconscious information into conscious awareness in order to induce <em>catharsis</em>. Catharsis is an emotional release that may bring about relief from psychological distress." <br />
"Research has found that psychoanalysis can be an effective treatment for a number of mental health conditions. The self-examination that is involved in the therapy process can help people achieve long-term growth and improvement" <br />
"Freud based his ideas on <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/how-to-write-a-psychology-case-study-2795722" class="external-link">case studies</a> of his own patients and those of his colleagues." <br />
"<a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/books-by-sigmund-freud-2795862" class="external-link">Freud's writings</a> detail many of his major theories and ideas. His personal favorite was 'The Interpretation of Dreams.'" <br />
"Some of Freud's major books include:   </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/the-interpretation-of-dreams-by-sigmund-freud-2795855" class="external-link">The Interpretation of Dreams</a>   </li>
<li>The Psychopathology of Everyday Life   </li>
<li>Totem and Taboo   </li>
<li>Civilization and Its Discontents   </li>
<li>The Future of an Illusion"   </li>
</ul>
<p>"Outside of the field of psychology, Freud wrote and theorized about a broad range of subjects. He also wrote about and developed theories related to topics including sex, dreams, religion, women, and culture." <br />
"While Freud's work is often dismissed today as non-scientific, there is no question that he had a tremendous influence not only on psychology but on the larger culture as well." <br />
"People are skeptical about the legitimacy of Freud's theories because they lack the scientific evidence that psychological theories have today." <br />
"Freud's theories are highly controversial today. For instance, he has been criticized for his lack of knowledge about women and for sexist notions in his theories about sexual development, hysteria, and penis envy." <br />
"However, it remains true that Freud had a significant and lasting influence on the field of psychology. He provided a foundation for many concepts that psychologists used and continue to use to make new discoveries." <br />
"Perhaps Freud's most important contribution to the field of psychology was the development of talk therapy as an approach to treating mental health problems. <br />
In addition to serving as the basis for psychoanalysis, talk therapy is now part of many psychotherapeutic interventions designed to help people overcome psychological distress and behavioral problems." <br />
"Prior to the works of Freud, many people believed that behavior was inexplicable. He developed the idea of the unconscious as being the hidden motivation behind what we do. For instance, his work on dream interpretation suggested that our real feelings and desires lie underneath the surface of conscious life." <br />
"Freud believed that childhood experiences impact adulthood—specifically, traumatic experiences that we have as children can manifest as mental health issues when we're adults. <br />
While childhood experiences aren't the only contributing factors to mental health during adulthood, Freud laid the foundation for a person's childhood to be taken into consideration during therapy and when diagnosing." <br />
"While Freud theorized that childhood experiences shaped personality, the neo-Freudians (including Carl Jung, Alfred Adler, and Karen Horney) believed that social and cultural influences played an important role.15 Freud believed that sex was a primary human motivator, whereas neo-Freudians did not." <br />
"While Freud's theories have been the subject of considerable controversy and debate, his impact on psychology, therapy, and culture is undeniable."   </p>
